      <h2>SDR RF Frontend | ECE 1100 Discovery Project</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
      This project focuses on developing an RF frontent evaluation module for a 
      software-defined radio (SDR), which is to be built in the future. The goal
      of this project is to enable wideband full-duplex communication across 
      a channel.
      </p>

      <h3>IQ Modulation and Demodulation</h3>
      <p>
      The RF frontend I want to design revolves around the zero-if (ZIF)
      architecture. The receiver must tune to the carrier frequency of the
      transmitted signal to mix it down to baseband and proceed with the
      processing required to extract the wanted information.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many ZIF architectures employ the use of IQ modulation and demodulation.
      The sum of two ampltiude modulated signals in quadrature (e.g cosine and
      sine) allows the implementation of almost any modulation technique at
      the output. This architecture also enables the decomposition of a
      modulated signal into easy to process baseband in-phase and quadrature
      signals, identical to the ones used to produce the transmitted signal.
      </p>

      <p>
      Using an IQ modulator IC and an IQ demodulator IC from Analog Devices is
      optimal since standalone mixers or connectorized components were much more
      expensive. 
      </p>
      <h3>Schematic</h3>
      <p>
      The RF frontend was designed in Altium and below is the schematic of the
      entire system, consisting of the two Analog Devices modulator and
      demodulator ICs and other passive components either necessary for
      operation or included for hardware configurability.
      </p>

      <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>
      The PCB was ordered from a chinese manufacturer and was assembled by me.
      I learned how to solder small SMD components by hand to be able to solder
      the QFN packages for the RF ICs and the 0402 and 0603 passive components.

      <h3>Transmission Line Characterization</h3>
      All transmission lines on the PCB were designed as 50 ohm coplanar 
      waveguides. A test transmission line was included on the very right of the
      circuit board to obtain its s-parameters. Using a network analyzer at the
      Hive Makerspace, the s-parameters were easily found and acquired shown
      below.

      <img src="img/s11.jpg" width="100%">
      The results weren't too great since the dielectric material between the
      top RF signal layer and its reference ground layer is FR4, which is not
      very suitable for high frequency applications. However, it seems like
      up to around 2 GHz the s-parameters are decent.
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      This taught me about IQ modulation and demodulation, RF impedance control, 
      RF PCB design, and SMD soldering. The future for this project is to
      develop a complete software-defined radio with the used RF ICs to
      implement a variety of digital communication waveforms and possibly GPS
      signal processing.
