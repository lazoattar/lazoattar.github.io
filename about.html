    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      Hello! My name is Lazo Attar and I'm a second-year electrical engineering
      student studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My concentrations
      are in telecommunications and circuit technology. I love the fields of
      telecommunications and electromagnetics, and I aspire to bring profound
      impact to these fields of engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of school, I'm from Houston, TX and I love me some barbeque.
      Brisket and burnt ends are my favorite even though Kansas has the latter
      better. I enjoy the Great Outdoors and I love to go hiking, hunting, and
      kayaking.
      </p>

      At Georgia Tech, I am heavliy involved in the Georgia Tech Experimental
      Rocketry Club as the flight computer lead. I love rockets and building
      computers for them is super exciting! I am also a Peer Instructor at the
      Hive Makerspace on campus and help users of the makerspace out with their
      awesome projects. It's always amazing to see the cool ideas my peers have
      and satisfying to help someone out with their project. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Career-wise I am currently seeking an internship for Summer 2025 in RF
      electronics or digital signal processing. I plan on completing by B.S.E.E.
      degree by Spring of 2026 and my M.S.E.E. by Spring of 2027 at Georgia
      Tech. After college I plan on working at an Aerospace or defense company
      designing novel waveforms.
